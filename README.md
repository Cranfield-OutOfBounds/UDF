# UDF


The objective of the UDF(user defined function) C code implementation is to compute those additional new source terms of the anisotropic hybrid k-w SST approach in the ANSYS-FLUENT environment which appear in the scalar momentum equations, in the turbulent kinetic energy equation, and in the transport equation of the specific dissipation rate.
